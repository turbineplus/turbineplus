			The energy resources are depleting  around the world which has directed the world towards alternate renewable energy sources. An abundance of these resources are present but all are beyond the reach of a common man, which is turning to be the biggest limitation in the socio-economic
			growth of not only an individual but also for the whole world as well. Yet another challenge is that none of these promote sustainable eco-system.

			Rising inflation has restricted the savings of a working class common man to be on the minimum side. Thus leaving the individual with minimal investment opportunities with high rate of return. The leftover opportunities to invest such as savings account and mutual funds are the ones from which the financial institutions are the major benficiaries, as the entire risk is transferred to the individual who has no control over the investment. </p>
